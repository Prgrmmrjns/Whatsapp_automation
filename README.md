# Whatsapp_automation

## About
* This Python script uses ChatGPT, Pushbullet and the Pywhatkit library to enable semi-automatic 
Whatsapp replies from ChatGPT

## Prerequisites
* Libraries installed: pushbullet, pywhatkit, pyChatGPT, keyboard
* Create a OpenAI account and a Pushbullet accout, both are for free

## Notes
* Note that both ChatGPT and Pushbullet have its limits regarding sending requests. 
  E.g. ChatGPT refuses to handle more than ~ 30 requests in an hour
* You need to login via the QR code scan to whatsappweb on your desktop the first time you start the script.
  Afterwards the login is done automatically
  
## Next steps
* Deploy code on a website
* Bypass initial whatsappweb login via QR code
* Give more options to individualize and modularize the ChatGPT prompt further

Have fun with my app and stay tuned for more!
